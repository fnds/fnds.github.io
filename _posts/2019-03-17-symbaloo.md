Symbaloo is a great tool for online bookmarks. Since I started using years ago Iâ€™ve never had to worry again about having
access to my bookmarks.

I looked at the many options out there and what attracted me to Symbaloo was the clean interface with large icons and tabs 
where I can keep all organized and have just the most important bookmarks on one page. No scrolling up and down to find stuff.

Set it as your browser home page and it will be there any time you need.

I hope it helps.
