"True godliness is a fruit of loving God with your heart. If you aim for outward godliness directly, all you end up being is a hypocritical Pharisee."

- We don't become godly by seeking godliness. The more we seek God and love Him, the more godly we become.
- "If you love me you will follow my commandments"
	- it doesn't say that obedience/godliness is the same as loving God.
	- it means that loving God leads to obedience
	- how do we love God? How do we grow in our love for God?
