# why

- Because God wrote a book. Do you think we should care about reading it?
- The Bible is the most important book ever written. 
- Every word in the Bible is exactly what God wanted to put on paper. God employed the authors' minds and handes to accomplish that.
- What could be more important than reading the words that God wrote?

# random thoughts

- Some people say they fall asleep when they try reading the Bible. 
  - Can you think of a better way to fall asleep? The last thing that passed through our eyes and mind is God's words.
  - In an age when many people have issues with insomnia God's word provides the cure. :)
- The Bible is not a user's manual or a guide for living. It's the account of who God is and his plan to bring his people into his
presence and under his rule forever.
